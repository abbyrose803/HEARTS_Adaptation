    "This notebook adapts a pre-trained ALBERT text-classification model (after attempting to train it on the GOV.UK dataset) to the **Davidson et al. (2017) Hate Speech Dataset**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to evaluate whether a stereotype-detection model can be successfully **repurposed and fine-tuned for hate-speech detection** within a socially critical Twitter context.\n",

    "- Reproduce and adapt the HEARTS MGSD baseline model\n",
    "- Fine-tune the model on the Davidson hate-speech dataset\n",
    "- Evaluate performance using accuracy, macro-F1, confusion matrix, and bootstrap confidence intervals\n",

    "### Original trial on GOV.UK\n",
    "\n",
    "- This can be found in the github, it has not been cleaned or made reproducible, as this was an unsuccesful attempt. It has been left in to show iteration and progress of this project (As adviced by Tigi).\n",
    "\n",
    "- I originally trained on a GOV.UK job adverts dataset, which collapsed due to the dataset exhibiting long sentences, with 30-50 tokens and very low linguistic variability and no abusive or profane language which led to overfitting causing the model to fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- I selected the new context of detecting online hate speech—specifically on Twitter in the United States—because the U.S. consistently reports high volumes of harmful, abusive, and polarising online content. Compared with GOV.UK job adverts, which were relatively formal, structured, and low-variance, Twitter presents a linguistically diverse, noisy, and high-risk environment where effective hate-speech detection has direct social impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "By adapting the MGSD ALBERT model to the Davidson et al. (2017) dataset and evaluating it through the HEARTS pipeline, this project assesses whether the original stereotype-detection model can be plausibly repurposed, successfully fine-tuned, and scaled to a more socially critical domain. Using HEARTS is appropriate here because HEARTS was designed specifically for text-based social bias, fairness, and sensitive-content detection—making it conceptually closer to hate-speech detection than GOV.UK adverts.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### This shift in context therefore serves two purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Practical alignment: The model is tested on a dataset whose linguistic style, label structure, and social stakes more closely resemble real-world harmful language detection tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability assessment: It demonstrates whether a model originally developed for stereotype detection can generalise to adjacent applications such as online hate-speech mitigation—supporting SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities), SDG 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions) and SDG 5 (Gender Equality). \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, applying the HEARTS evaluation workflow to the Davidson dataset provides a realistic indication of this model’s feasibility, robustness, and potential value within broader online safety, content moderation, and humanitarian AI settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### This Dataset was appropriate as it: \n",
    "- (1) Exhibits a large annotated corpus (24k) ideal for fine-tuning transformer models without overfitting. \n",
    "- (2) Reflects real-world linguistic challenges of social media, suitable for real-world applications.\n",
    "- (3) Widely used and benchmarked allowing for reproducibility.\n",
    "- (4) It offers 3 label classifications, that map directly onto a 3-class ALBERT model.\n",
    "- (5) It’s ethically sourced, from public tweets, no personal user information, transparent annotation and peer-reviewed. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dataset Limitations include: \n",
    "\n",
    "- (1) Imbalance: Hate speech is extremely underrepresented (~5%). \n",
    "- (2) Ambiguity: Many tweets contain sarcasm, coded language, or lack context.\n",
    "- (3) Racial slur ambiguity: slurs are automatically classified as offensive, but this can depend on context — difficult for models. (3) Dataset is from 2017: Language, platform norms, and hate speech have evolved since then.\n",
    "- (4) No demographic metadata: cannot measure fairness across targeted groups."

    "### Comparison of Baseline (MGSD ALBERT), Reproduced Baseline, and Hate-Speech Model\n",
    "\n",
    "- I utilised the ALBERT-v2 as the primary baseline as it is the strongest performing model implemented in the official HEARTS codebase, with good macro-F1 performance across the MGSD test set. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Results: \n",
    "- Accuracy: The MGSD baseline achieves 0.833, while the adapted model reaches 0.920, representing an absolute gain of +0.087. This indicates that the adapted classifier is substantially more effective at distinguishing between hate, offensive, and neutral content than the MGSD model was at stereotype detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Macro-F1: The baseline macro-F1 is 0.812, compared to 0.746 for the hate-speech model (a decrease of –0.066). This drop is expected because macro-F1 penalises class imbalance, and the Davidson dataset has highly uneven class distributions (majority “offensive”, minority “hate”). Despite this, the adapted classifier still performs competitively, indicating strong generalisation to minority classes relative to domain difficulty.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Weighted F1:\n",
    "This improves from 0.832 (baseline) to 0.912 (adapted), an increase of +0.080. Indicating that the adapted model performs particularly well on high-frequency classes while still maintaining reasonable generalisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Justification of Metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The original MGSD work uses macro-F1 as its primary model selection metric, with accuracy as a secondary indicator.\n",
    "- Thus, I evaluated the adapted model using the same two metrics to ensure fair, interpretable cross-task comparison. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interpretation and Implications\n",
    "\n",
    "- These results indicate a strong performance and show that ALBERT transfers effectively to a domain where the label structure and linguistic phenomena better match the intended application. Accuracy and weighted-F1 support the conclusion that the adapted classifier is significantly stronger for this application than the original MGSD model, which was designed for a different linguistic phenomenon (stereotype detection).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Moreover, the MGSD baseline serves as a benchmark for stereotype-detection quality, whereas the Davidson-trained model represents a re-purposed classifier optimised for online hate-speech detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The macro-F1 decrease reflects the increased difficulty of minority-class discrimination in the Davidson dataset, rather than a failure of the model adaptation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion:\n",
    "- Overall, the adapted ALBERT model demonstrates strong and meaningful improvements over the MGSD baseline on task-appropriate metrics, validating the model adaptation pipeline and confirming that ALBERT transfers effectively to hate-speech detection. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The original dataset I tested earlier, GOV.UK job-ad descriptions, did not train well on the HEARTS pipeline due to fundamental mismatches in domain, linguistic style, and label structure. GOV.UK contains long, formal, occupational descriptions with mild or no stereotyping, whereas HEARTS and Davidson’s hate-speech dataset both contain short, informal, and sentiment-rich social-media text. As a result, the GOV.UK model produced extremely low accuracy and macro-F1 on HEARTS (e.g., accuracy ≈ 0.017), indicating that it is not an appropriate baseline for evaluating a hate-speech or stereotype-sensitive classifier.\n"

The largest number of correct predictions lies on the diagonal for these categories, supporting the high overall accuracy and weighted F1 score.\n",

    "The main limitation appears in the 'Hate Speech' class, where many instances are misclassified as 'Offensive'. \n",

    "### Failure Case Analysis \n",
    "\n",
    "To systematically assess the remaining limitations of the adapted model, 396 misclassified instances were examined, representing 8% of the validation set. Error distribution analysis indicates that the majority of misclassifications occur between the hate_speech and offensive classes, as reflected by the largest off-diagonal values in the confusion matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "A recurrent pattern is the prediction of offensive when the ground truth label is hate_speech, suggesting reduced recall for the minority hate-speech category. High-confidence error inspection further reveals multiple instances where the model assigns >99% probability to incorrect labels, indicating systematic boundary or calibration issues rather than random noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Qualitative inspection of these high-confidence errors shows that many examples contain lexical profanity, reclaimed slurs, or informal dialectal language (e.g., AAVE). This suggests that the classifier disproportionately relies on surface lexical cues instead of contextual or target-specific semantic signals. Conversely, several non-toxic (“neither”) tweets are misclassified as offensive, implying an over-sensitivity to swear words in the absence of harmful intent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collectively, these findings indicate that although the adapted model demonstrates a substantial macro-F1 improvement, residual weaknesses persist in distinguishing abusive language subtypes that differ primarily in intent, target specificity, and pragmatic context, rather than explicit lexical content."

    "### 4 Main Failure Cases & Possible future improvements: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Hate Speech Misclassified as Offensive:**\n",
    "The model frequently under-detects hate speech when profanity or slurs resemble general offensive language (Figure 1). This pattern is likely influenced by class imbalance, where the offensive category constitutes approximately 77% of the dataset, biasing the classifier toward the majority class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Possible Improvements:** \n",
    "- Introduce target-aware modelling (who is being targeted, not just what words are used).\n",
    "- Apply class-weighted loss or focal loss to counter class imbalance.\n",
    "- Expand training data with minority hate-speech examples and ethically sourced targeted-hate datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **High-Confidence Incorrect Predictions:**\n",
    "Several misclassifications occur with >99% predicted probability (Figure 2), indicating systematic decision-boundary or calibration issues rather than random noise. These errors suggest the model is confidently relying on misleading lexical cues.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Possible Improvements:** \n",
    "- Use probability calibration methods (e.g., temperature scaling, Platt scaling).\n",
    "- Implement hard-negative mining to retrain on confidently misclassified samples.\n",
    "- Add uncertainty estimation or confidence thresholds before final classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Quoted or Indirect Speech Failures:**\n",
    "The model struggles to distinguish between the author’s voice and quoted or reported speech, often interpreting quoted content as the speaker’s own stance. This reflects a limitation in discourse-level and speaker-attribution understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Possible Improvements:** \n",
    "- Incorporate context-window or conversation-history models instead of single-tweet inputs.\n",
    "- Add discourse-aware or sarcasm/pragmatics modules.\n",
    "- Train with annotated quote / reply / retweet metadata to model speaker attribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Implicit or Coded Hate Speech:**\n",
    "Slur-free but semantically harmful statements are frequently misclassified, demonstrating difficulty with pragmatic inference and contextual nuance. These cases lack explicit lexical markers yet convey discriminatory intent (e.g., indirect exclusionary phrases), revealing limitations in intent and target recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Possible Improvements:** \n",
    "\n",
    "- Use continual learning or dynamic lexicon updates to adapt to evolving coded language.\n",
    "- Integrate semantic or knowledge-graph features to capture indirect hostility.\n",
    "- Explore multi-task learning with intent and target detection rather than surface toxicity alone.\n"

    "### Critical Reflections on SDGs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Across SDGs 5, 10, and 16, the model’s contributions are meaningful but conditional on governed implementation and adaptation of the model according to the failure cases. \n",
    "- The confusion matrix and failure-case analysis show that the model struggles with pragmatic inference, context tracking, quoted content, sarcasm, and implicit or coded hate. \n",
    "- These weaknesses create potential blind spots that could undermine progress toward reducing inequality and protecting marginalised groups. \n",
    "- Ethically, automated moderation systems risk reinforcing biases if not carefully audited. \n",
    "- False negatives may allow harmful content to persist, while false positives may disproportionately silence certain communities, especially those using reclaimed language or non-standard dialects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ethical Implications:\n",
    "- The over-reliance on lexical cues which can cause marginalised communities to become undermined, if reclaiming terms.\n",
    "- Failure cases need to be fixed before scaling, as they can enable harmful messages to persist conflicting with SDGs 5 & 10.\n",
    "- Bias Propagation: The dataset is imbalanced and relies heavily on surface level toxic keywords and lacks identity labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Actionable Policy & Recommendations:\n",
    "- Regular bias auditing & monitoring – supporting sdg 16\n",
    "- Guardrails Against Over-Reliance on Lexical Cues – supports sdg 10, mitigating discriminatory behaviour\n",
    "- For scalability - training data diversification across dialects and global regions and possibly expanded to detection against certain groups."
