    "This notebook documents my initial attempt to adapt the HEARTS model architecture to a new domain: the GOV.UK Job Listing dataset. \n",
    "- The motivation was to explore whether the stereotype-detection framework could be repurposed for identifying biased or exclusionary language within government job advertisements. \n",
    "- To test this, I began by installing the necessary HuggingFace and PyTorch dependencies within a clean environment and preparing the dataset for fine-tuning. However, after preliminary preprocessing and exploratory testing, it became clear that the GOV.UK dataset was not suitable for this task. \n",
    "- Unlike HEARTS, it contains no annotated stereotype or bias labels, the language is highly formal, and harmful/offensive patterns are extremely sparse. As a result, the model failed to learn meaningful decision boundaries, producing collapsed predictions and unstable training behaviour. \n",
    "- This notebook therefore serves as evidence of the attempted adaptation and demonstrates why a labelled hate-speech dataset (Davidson et al., 2017) was ultimately selected instead, as it provides the necessary signal for supervised learning and enables a valid evaluation of adaptation performance.\n",

    "The training loss decreases steadily from ~2.5 to ~0.4, indicating that the model successfully learns to fit the GOV.UK job advert data. However, this does not imply meaningful model performance for stereotype detection. The GOV.UK dataset contains no stereotypical, biased, or harmful language annotations, so the model is optimising for an unrelated classification target. The smooth convergence highlights that the learning process is functioning, but the underlying task is misaligned, confirming that this dataset is unsuitable for the intended application."
